# Newton

---

Newton is a web framework that builds on of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com), inspired by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com).
It can be difficult to quickly get an Express.js project up and running, so Newton was built to make it easier to quickly create a project. By default, it uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)) and runs at port 8000, but it can be easily configured.
